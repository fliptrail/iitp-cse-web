                    The objective of the International Conference on Data Science and 
                    Engineering (ICDSE 2019)is to provide a congenial yet serious 
                    platform for experts from academia and industry to interact with 
                    young researchers in Data Science and Engineering. This is an 
                    interdisciplinary conference that aims at diverse fields of Science, 
                    engineering and technology with a focus on data analytics and smart 
                    systems design and development. The major attempt of the conference 
                    is to bring out this event to be a forum for researchers and practitioners 
                    to come together from all different fields of study such as Mechanical
                    , Electrical, Environmental, Chemical, Electronics and Computer 
                    Engineering to foster the needs of data processing in modern human
                    life. ICDSE 2019 welcomes submissions that have not been published
                    and that are not under review by another conference or journal. 
                    All submissions will be evaluated on their originality, technical
                    soundness, significance, presentation, and interest to the 
                    conference attendees. Paper Submission All full papers 
                    submitted will be subjected to a review process through

                    to be double blind reviewed by three experts on the basis 
                    of originality, novelty, clarity, completeness, relevance, 
                    significance and research contribution We look forward to
